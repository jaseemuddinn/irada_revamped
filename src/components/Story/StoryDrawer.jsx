            IRADA- What's Our Story?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The idea for the inception of the Youth Action and Leadership Forum
            for Environment can be attributed to Achintya, a passionate young
            advocate for environmental concerns.
            <br />
            <br />
            The journey began with attending an international conference on
            "Emissions monitoring", driven by genuine curiosity and a desire for
            knowledge. Engaging with a diverse group of individuals, Achintya
            actively participated in the two-day training workshop, forging
            valuable connections and expanding his network in the process.
            <br />
            Subsequently, Achintya expanded his involvement by participating in
            multiple conferences addressing critical issues such as climate
            change, clean energy transition and circular economy, among others.
            These engagements allowed him to amass knowledge, engage with
            various stakeholders, and gain hands-on learning experiences.
            Throughout this transformative process, he consistently observed a
            common yet distinctive insightâ€” the paramount importance of youth
            involvement.
            <br />
            <br />
            Realising the significant disparity between the discussions and
            statements made in these forums and the actual implementation of
            effective measures on the ground, the idea of this youth driven
            Youth Action and Leadership Forum for Environment was born which
            underscored the urgent need for dedicated platforms that would
            facilitate serious youth-led deliberations, foster meaningful
            discussions, and provide forums for impactful dialogue within the
            environmental domain.
